# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What's **dot** product?

A scalar value produced by 2 vectors which comes very useful in many cases, mostly when
looking to find the angle between them by using

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
$$
\angle pq = \arccos{ \frac {p \cdot q}{|p||q|}}
$$
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What's a normal? If you are given a surface, how do you compute the normal?

A vector perpendicular to a given surface - useful when you want to know how a
physical object reflect—Å from the surface (e.g. a ball or a ray of light).

<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Computed via the **cross product** -
$$
N = p \times q \\\\
\text{where} \ p \ \text{and} \ q \ \text{define} \ \text{the} \ \text{surface}
$$
<!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->


--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What are these, what are they used for and what are their pros and cons:

* Euler angles
  * Angles around X, Y, Z - useful for humans, terrible for code <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Axis + angle
  * Occasionally useful for humans, terrible for code <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Rotation matrices
  * Awful for humans, best for concatenating transforms, memory inefficient <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* Quaternions
  * Awful for humans, best for storage & manipulation <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

Why would you change your coordinate system? How do you do that?

Changing the coordinate system makes some geometrical tasks trivial (e.g. arbitrary rotation).
You do it through a matrix created from the target system's origin and axes.

## Back to the roots (math)

Physics is awesome but you probably don't really need all the pain it brings.

## Physics purpose

* Destruction
* Rag-dolls
* Machinery and vehicles
* Dangling items animations

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Physics complications

* Predictability
* Tuning
* Emergent behaviour
* Being artist-friendly (3D models must not break apart when physics is applied)
* Being designer-friendly (setting up physics interaction should not require a PhD)

## Physics vs. Collision

* Collision detects contacts between game objects.
* Physics makes things move

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## World separation

* Physics simulation / collision detection use specialized data structures
* It makes sense to separate the game world from the physics world
* Each game entity need only an identifier to the corresponding physics entity

```cpp
gameWorld->Update(dt);
physicsWorld->Update(dt);
for (auto& entity : gameEntities)
{
    entity.Position = physicsWorld->GetPositionFor(entity);
}
```

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Collision system tasks

* Detect collisions between objects
* Report collisions and relevant data
    - point of contact
    - separating vector
* Collision queries

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Collision primitives (aka bounding volumes)

* Collision can be done per mesh but that's wasteful
* Imagine having to check if any triangle from one mesh intersects any triangle from another

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Collision primitives (aka bounding volumes)

* Use simple shapes / hierarchies of simple shapes
    * Spheres / Capsules
    * Boxes (AABB & OBB)
    * Tetrahedron
    * Convex Vs. concave
* Primitives can have transforms

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Spheres

![Bounding sphere](resources/19.physics/bounding_sphere.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### ...and capsules

![Bounding capsule](resources/19.physics/bounding_capsule.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Boxes

Axis-Oriented Bounding Boxes (AABB) have their sides always aligned
to the world basis vectors. Must be recomputed after each rotation!

![AABB](resources/19.physics/aabb.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### OBB

Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) require a matrix transformation to
be axis-aligned during collision checks; AABBs do so at creation time.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Comparison

| Bounding volume | Intersection complexity | Cons | Best for |
| --------------- | ---- | ---- | -------- |
| Sphere | Trivial, ignores rotation | Often wastes space | Crude approximation / shape casts / spherical items |
| Capsule | Fast | Slower than sphere | Humanoids |
| AABB | Fast | Wastes space when rotated | Box-like, static shapes |
| OOBB | Slow | Fits boxes perfectly | Box-like, dynamic shapes |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Hierarchies

Standard primitive shapes are crude; full-blown meshes are expensive

![Bounding hierarchy](resources/19.physics/bounding_capsule_hierarchy.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Convex Vs. concave

![Convex kitties](resources/19.physics/convex_concave_kitty.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Convex Vs. concave

* Intersections with arbitrary polyhedra is manageable as long as shapes are **convex**
* <!-- .element class="fragment" --> A shape is convex if any of these equivalent statements is true:
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" --> No line segment between any two points goes outside of the shape
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" --> No plane can divide the space into two half-spaces each of which
  containing at least one point of the shape
  * <!-- .element class="fragment" --> No angle is more than 180 deg

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Convex Vs. concave

![Convex kitties](resources/19.physics/convex_vs_concave.jpg)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Solving collisions
### Sphere Vs. sphere

Given $K_1(O_1, r_1), K_2(O_2, r_2)$, collision happens if

$$
|K_2 - K_1|^2 <= (r_1 + r_2)^2
$$ <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->

Important: notice the squared distance! <!-- .element class="fragment" data-index="0" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Non-spherical shapes
#### Separating axis theorem

Let $A$ and $B$ be two disjoint convex sets in $R^n$. Then
there exists an axis $a$ such that the projection of
$A$ and $B$ on $a$ don't overlap.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

![Separating axis theorem](resources/19.physics/separating_axis_theorem_counterexample.svg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### AABB Vs. AABB

Since AABBs are always axis-aligned, the separating axis may only be
one of the three basis vectors.

Given $B_1(min_1, max_1), B_2(min_2, max_2)$, collision happens if

$$
min\_{1\_x} > max\_{2\_x} \land min\_{2\_x} > max\_{1\_x} \land \\\\
min\_{1\_y} > max\_{2\_y} \land min\_{2\_y} > max\_{1\_y} \land \\\\
min\_{1\_z} > max\_{2\_z} \land min\_{2\_z} > max\_{1\_z} \land \\\\
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

In code:

```cpp
Box b1;
Box b2;
const bool doBoxesIntersect =
    b1.min.x > b2.max.x && b2.min.x > b1.max.x &&
    b1.min.y > b2.max.y && b2.min.y > b1.max.y &&
    b1.min.z > b2.max.z && b2.min.z > b1.max.z;

if (doBoxesIntersect)
{ ... }
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### What do we do with OOBB?

Apply matrix transform to convert to AABB and use above formula!
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

### Contact information

If the two shapes can be described analytically, then it's really easy:

1. Assume the two shapes intersect at some point $C$ <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
2. Create a system from the 2 equations and replace one in the other <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Contact information

Assume that we need the point of contact $C$ between
a line $L$ and a sphere $S$:

$$
L: C = M + p * \mu \\\\
S: |C - O| = r
$$

Then:

$$
|M + p * \mu - O| = r
$$

Solve for $\mu$ and you are done!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Let's do some exercises

1. Solve contact information for a plane and a line segment
1. Solve contact information for a ray and a box

# Hardcore physics time

![Grumpy cat loves people crying to physics](https://68.media.tumblr.com/4145aca3a2e28539f38b2f0bfcf52ac9/tumblr_oj3tweceeC1w24mito1_500.jpg)

## Mechanics branches

* Classical Vs. Quantum Vs. Relativistic
* Newtonian Vs. Langrangian Vs. Hamiltonian
* Statics Vs. Kinematics Vs. Dynamics
* Rigid bodies Vs. Deformable bodies Vs. Fluids

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Newtonian rigid body dynamics simulation

We care about finding the position & rotation of a given object, assuming
that our world is a Newtonian rigid body dynamics simulation.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Some notes before we start

* Fix the units to KMS (kilogram, meter, second)
* Linear and angular motion are independent and can be separately simulated
* All forces are applied at the center of mass of the object. Conveniently defined as
the point at which relative mass distribution is zero

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Notation

* Reminder that the derivative of $f(x)$ is written as $\frac {df}{dx}$
* The second derivative of $f(x)$ is written as $\frac {d^2f}{dx^2}$
* The derivative of $f(t)$ where $t$ is time is written as $\dot{f}(t)$
* Unbolded $f(x)$ means $f$ is a function returning a scalar
* Bolded $\mathbf{f}(x)$ means $\mathbf{f}$ is a function returning a vector

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Linear dynamics

Idealize the object to its center of mass

* Linear dynamics gives a solution to the function $\mathbf{S}(t)$
  - the position at a given time $t$
* Derive once, get velocity: $\mathbf{v}(t) = \frac {d\mathbf{S}}{dt}$ <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
  - Velocity is a vector quantity! Speed is a scalar! <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->
* Derive twice, get acceleration: $\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac {d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac {d^2\mathbf{S}}{dt^2}$ <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:
* Another important quantity is the *linear momentum*
    - $\mathbf{p}(t) = m(t)\mathbf{v}(t)$
    - Usually mass is constant - $\mathbf{p}(t) = m\mathbf{v}(t)$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Force

* Any interaction that will change the motion of an object.
* Forces are represented by a displacement vector
* If multiple forces are applied, the net force is just the sum

$$
\mathbf{F} = \sum\_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F_i}
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

The job of the physics system is, given a set of forces $\mathbf{F_i}$ acting on the object, to
compute the position $\mathbf{S}(t)$ at any given time $t$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Netwon's second law

Gives a second equation for the acceleration:

$$
\mathbf{F\_{net}} = m\mathbf{a}(t), \text{if } m = const \\\\
\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac {\mathbf{F\_{net}}} {m}
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### A wild ODE appears

* We know that $\ddot{\mathbf{S}}(t)=\mathbf{a}(t)$
* And that $\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac {\mathbf{F\_{net}}} {m} = \frac {1}{m} \sum\_{i=1}^n \mathbf{F_i}$
* So solving the position is as easy as solving

$$
\ddot{\mathbf{S}}(t)= \frac {\mathbf{F\_{net}}} {m}
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Free fall example

$$
F_g = gm \\\\
\ddot{y}(t) = \frac {F_g} {m} \\\\
\ddot{y}(t) = g \\\\
\dot{y}(y) = gt + v_0 \\\\
y(t) = \frac {1}{2} gt^2 + v_0t + y_0
$$ <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### It gets worse

* Most forces aren't constant like the gravitational force. Some even depend on the current position and velocity!
* It's impossible to integrate the right-hand side of the equation of motion for arbitrary forces

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Numerical integration

* A derivative is the change over an infinitestimal quantity
* It defines the slope of the tangent at a given point
* Thus, the actual function can be approximated with linear interpolation of the tangent

![tangent](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Tangent_derivative_calculusdia.svg/561px-Tangent_derivative_calculusdia.svg.png)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Numerical integration

$$
\mathbf{a}(t) = \frac {\mathbf{F\_{net}(t)}} {m} \\\\
\mathbf{v}(t + \Delta t) = \mathbf{v}(t) + \mathbf{a}(t) \Delta t \\\\
\mathbf{S}(t) = \mathbf{S}(t) + \mathbf{v}(t) \Delta t
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Integrators

* An integrator is an algorithm for...integrating!
* What we did on the previous slide is called an *implicit Euler integrator*!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Integrator properties

* Convergence - does it give a correct result?
* Stability - does it add or remove energy to the system?
* Order - check against the Taylor's series; how big of an error does it accumulate?

$$
f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (\frac {f^{(n)}(a)} {n!})(x - a)^n
$$

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

### Other integrators

* Explicit (forward) Euler, Semiexplicit Euler
* Verlet
* Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4)

## Angular dynamics...or not

Up until now we only solved for the
position of the object.

Rotation is really similar but I'll give you a pass on this one.

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Collision response

What happens when 2 things colide?

Energy...must be...conserved!

$$
\mathbf{p}_1 + \mathbf{p}_2 = \mathbf{p'}_1 + \mathbf{p'}_2
$$

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Physics implementation / integration

Split game entities / bodies by driver:

* Fixed bodies
* Game-driven bodies
    - Limit physics effect
    - Infinite mass
    - Move with impulses
* Physics-driven bodies

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

void PhysicsEngine::Step()
{
    const float TIME_STEP = 1 / 60.f;

    * Is this thing elastic?
    * Do things slide over it?
    * Do things bounce?
