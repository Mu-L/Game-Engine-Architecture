# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

## Unreal's pretty good at networking

![Kitties networking](http://i.imgur.com/O00xD.jpg)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Network topology

UE uses client-server and client-server only

* Greatly simplifies code
* Let's you have clear rules when does someone do something
* P2P's main advantage (not having you to manage traffic)
can be simulated by running local servers
* Saves you maintenance
    - NAT modes

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Client-server model

UE excels because it strictly follows certain policies

* All clients and the server run the simulation
* The server is the **only** authority
* Clients only talk to the server

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Connection protocol

...is totally documented!

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Connection protocol

1. Client sends a connect request.
1. If the server accepts, it will send the current map.
1. The server will wait for the client to load this map.
1. Once loaded, the server will then locally call `AGameMode::PreLogin`.
    * `AGameMode` may reject the connection

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

1. If accepted, the server will then call `AGameMode::Login`
    * Creates the `PlayerController`, replicates it, deletes the local one
    * Note that `APlayerController::BeginPlay` will be called here.
    * It is NOT yet safe to call RPC functions on this actor.
    Wait until `AGameMode::PostLogin` is called.
1. If things went well, `AGameMode::PostLogin` is called.
    * Safe to call things

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Ownership

* The client owns its player controller
* Any other object whose outermost owner is the player controller
is also owned by the same client (connection)
* Ownership is used during both replication and RPC

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Roles

`ENetRole`
* `ROLE_Authority` - this game instance can do whatever it likes with the actor (only used on the server)
* `ROLE_SimulatedProxy` - this game instance only simulates the actor
* `ROLE_AutonomousProxy` - this game instance has some control over the actor (e.g. player controller)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Roles

* `AActor::Role` - the role of this actor in the local instance
* `AActor::RemoteRole` - the role of this actor in the remote instance

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Relevancy

UE only sends updates for actors that are relevant to the remote instance.

See `AActor::IsNetRelevantFor` as the rules for this are awfully complicated.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Priority

UE limits traffic and updates based on its priority for the game.

* The higher the actor's priority, the more often it is updated *compared
to all the other actors*.
* Priority is taken from `AActor::GetNetPriority()`
* Priority is multiplied by the last replication time to avoid starvation

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Priority defaults

* Actor = 1.0
* Matinee = 2.7
* Pawn = 3.0
* PlayerController = 3.0

## Replication

![Kitten replication](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a1/8c/a2/a18ca2574a54b5078b2aaa50913bb2ff.jpg)

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Replication

...is what UE calls it's synchronization primitive
at the gameplay level.

* Done at the actor level

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Replicating actor properties

```cpp
UPROPERTY(Replicated)
uint32 CutenessLevel;
...
AKittyActor::AKittyActor(...)
{
    SetReplicates(true); // bReplicates = true;
    SetReplicateMovement(true); // bReplicatesMovement = true;
}
void AKittyActor::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps( TArray< FLifetimeProperty > & OutLifetimeProps ) const
{
    DOREPLIFETIME(uint32, CutenessLevel);
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Replication

* Actors can replicate state and function calls alike
* If you are replicating a property of type `AActor`, the other actor
must be replicated too
* Actor refs work automagically! See `FNetGUID`
* Non-replicated properties are simulated independently

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Replication notification

```cpp
UPROPERTY(RepNotify)
uint32 CutenessLevel;

void AKittyActor::OnRep_CutenessLevel() {...}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Component replication

* Don't use `UPROPERTY(Replicated)`
* Call `Component->SetIsReplicated(true);`

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Conditional replication

```cpp
void AActor::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps( TArray< FLifetimeProperty > & OutLifetimeProps ) const
{
    DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION( AActor, ReplicatedMovement, COND_SimulatedOnly );
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Conditional replication

| Condition | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| COND_InitialOnly | Only sent at initialization |
| COND_OwnerOnly | Only sent to the actor's owner |
| COND_SkipOwner | Sent to every connection EXCEPT the owner |
| COND_SimulatedOnly | Only sent to simulated actors |
| COND_AutonomousOnly | Only sent to autonomous actors |
| COND_SimulatedOrPhysics | Only sent to simulated OR bRepPhysics actors |
| COND_InitialOrOwner | Only sent on the initial packet, or to the actors owner |
| COND_Custom | No particular condition, but wants the ability to toggle on/off via SetCustomIsActiveOverride |

## RPC

```cpp
UFUNCTION(Server / Client / NetMulticast)
void FooSomeBar();
```

* Must be called on (replicated & (owned | authorized)) actors
* RPC's are unreliable and are generally used for cosmetic events
* Unless you tag them `UFUNCTION(Reliable)`
* Prefix each function with its proper usage

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## RPC

```cpp
UFUNCTION(Server, WithValidation) // WithValidation is required for Server
void ServerFooSomeBar(Bar* bar);

void AMyActor::ServerFooSomeBar_Validate(Bar* bar) {...}
void AMyActor::ServerFooSomeBar_Implementation(Bar* bar) {...}
```

## High-level replication flow

[Click me](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/ReplicationFlow/index.html)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Gameplay classes extended review

* `AGameMode` - the game's rules
* `AGameState` - the game's state i.e. what needs to be broadcast
* `APlayerController` - the player's rules
* `APlayerState` - the player's state i.e. what needs to be broadcast
* The GameMode and Player controller are not synchronized!
* Only the owning connections instantiate `AGameMode` / `APlayerController`

## Level travelling

* Seamless Vs. Nonseamless travelling
* Travelling
    - `UEngine::Browse`
    - `UWorld::ServerTravel`
    - `APlayerController::ClientTravel`
* Seamlessly travelling actors*
    - Owned game mode and player controllers
    - `GetSeamlessTravelActorList`

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Implementation details
#### `UNetDriver`

* Takes care of ticking connections
* The client only has one connection; the server has N

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### `UNetConnection`

* Contains a list of channels to replicate
* Uses `UChildConnection` to support split-screen

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

#### Channels

* Updates a specific thing in the engine
* `UControlChannel`
    - handshaking; object loading; non-gameplay
* `UVoiceChannel`
    - used for voice chat; supports a ton of things
* `UActorChannel`
    - a channel per actor; controls creation
    - see `FObjectReplicatior` for replication

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Tools

* Watch for `LogNet`
* `Stat Net`
* `Net Pkt*`
* Network replay - See the ShooterGame

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Tips

* Optimizations
    - Don't replicate blindly
    - Reduce relevancy and priority
    - Reduce `NetUpdateFrequency`
    - `FName`s are passed as strings!
* `UNavigationSystem` only exists on the server!

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Want more?

* `UCharacterMovementComponent` & `UProjectileMovementComponent`
* The HTTP modules
*
* See advanced methods `PreReplication`,
`ReplicateSubojbects`, `OnSubobject...Replicated`

## Online subsystem

* Session / matchmaking helper
* Can be reimplemented by your custom system
* Provides a default implementation for Steam
